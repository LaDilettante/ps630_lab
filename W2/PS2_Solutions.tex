\section*{1. Expected Value and Its Properties}

\subsection*{a.} (1/4 point) (DeGroot, p. 216) Suppose that one word is to be selected at random from the sentence `the girl put on her beautiful red hat`. If X denotes the number of letters in the word that is selected, what is the value of E(X)?

\textbf{Solution}

As the number of letters in a word, $X$ can take on following values: $x \in \{2, 3, 4, 9 \}$, with probability as follows:

\begin{align}
P(X = 2) &= \frac{1}{8} \qquad \text{(1 word (``on'') out of 8 words in the sentence)} \\
P(X = 3) &= \frac{5}{8} \\
P(X = 4) &= \frac{1}{8} \\
P(X = 9) &= \frac{1}{8}
\end{align}

Therefore,

$$E(X) = \sum_{all x_i} x_i P(X = x_i) = 3.75$$

\subsection*{b.} (2/4 point) (Degroot p. 216) Suppose that one letter is to be selected at random from
the 30 letters in the sentence given in Exercise 4. If Y
denotes the number of letters in the word in which the
selected letter appears, what is the value of E(Y)?

Hint: 1a) and 1b) force you to think carefully about the definition of expectation value. For each problem, think about what is your random variable ($X$), which values it takes on ($x \in \{?, ?, ...\}$) and with what probability ($P(X = x) = ?$)

\subsection*{c.} (1/4 point) (Degroot, p. 224) Suppose that three random variables $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$ are uniformly distributed on the interval [0, 1]. They are also independent. Determine the value of $E[(X_1 âˆ’ 2X_2 + X_3)^2]$.

\section*{2. Variance and its properties}

For this problem, you can use the properties of expected value.

\subsection*{a.} (1/4 point) Prove that $Var(aX + b) = a^2 Var(X)$.

\subsection*{b.} (2/4 point) Prove that if two random variables are independent, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variance. In other words, if $X_1, X_2$ are independent, then

$$Var(X_1 + X_2) = Var(X_1) + Var(X_2)$$

\subsection*{c.} (1/4 point) (Degroot, p. 232) Suppose that one word is selected at random from the sentence `the girl put on her beautiful red hat`. If $X$ denotes the number of letters in the word that is selected, what is the value of $Var(X)$?


\section*{3. Binomial distribution}

(Credit to Jan) This problem is taken from Pitman (1993) Probability

Suppose a fair coin is tossed n times. Find a simple formula in terms of n and k for the following probability: $Pr(k\ heads | k-1\ heads\ or\ k\ heads)$. Please pay close attention to the formula, particularly what event is conditioned on what events. (Ch. 2.1, Problem 10 b) (p. 91)

Hint 1: Use the binomial distribution to model this.

Hint 2: Because those events are mutually exclusive, calculate the following:

$\dfrac{Pr(k\ heads)}{Pr (k\ heads) + Pr (k-1\ heads)}$

This is true because: $Pr(A | B) = \dfrac{Pr (A \cap B)}{Pr (B)}$

The intersection of events A and B in this case, $Pr (k\ heads \cap (k\ heads \cup k-1\ heads))$, reduces to $Pr(k\ heads)$ because the two events are mutually exclusive.

\section*{4. Plotting distribution}

For this problem, you'll need to Google some R techniques (e.g. side-by-side / overlapping plot). Also, label the axes and the plots accordingly.

\subsection*{a.} (1/4 point) Download a variable you are interested in, using \verb`WDI`. Plot the histogram, density plot, boxplot, and normal quantile plot.

\subsection*{b.} (1/4 point) Plot the histogram of that variable for Europe and Asia, 1) side by side (Hint: \verb`par(mfrow=c(?, ?))`), and 2) overlapping in the same plot.

\subsection*{c.} (1/4 point) Draw the scatterplot of that variable against another variable.

\subsection*{d.} (1/4 point) Label the point that represents your country (Hint: \href{https://chemicalstatistician.wordpress.com/2013/03/02/adding-labels-to-points-in-a-scatter-plot-in-r/}{Tutorial}) and color it red (Some Googling involved)
