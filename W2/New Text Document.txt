**Topic 6: Distributions, histograms, and density plots**

Let us look at the Binomial distribution:

```{r}
binomdraws=rbinom(n=1000,size=100,prob=0.33)
binomdraws
```

Let us plot this in a histogram, it's a discrete distribution:

```{r}
hist(binomdraws, main="1000 Draws from a Binomial(n=100,p=0.33)")
mean(binomdraws)
```

What does this distribution look like? Why does it look like that?

Let us also look at draws from a normal distribution:

```{r}
normdraws=rnorm(n=1000,mean=10,sd=5)
normdensity=density(normdraws)
plot(normdensity, main="Density of Draws from Normal")
```

Start with your homework early. Ask others for help. Work together. But always make sure that you understand the solution fully and write it down yourself and independent from others.
