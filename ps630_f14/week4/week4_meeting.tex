\section{Readings}

\begin{itemize}
\item Re-read week 1 chapters on vectors
\item If you can't do our vectors exercise after reading the chapter, do the Introduction and/or Vector chapter on \url{www.datacamp.com}, which is a Codeacademy-type site for R
\end{itemize}

\section{In-class excercises}

I will re-do Week 1 exercises on the board. Please take this chance to ask ANY question you may have.

If you could do Week 1 exercises by yourself, you really should belong to the self-study group. Note that I still reserve half an hour each week to answer questions to both groups, so the self-study group is not alone!

\section{Other announcements}

\begin{itemize}
\item You now have the option to re-grade someone's homework in case you made a mistake in grading the first time
\item You are REQUIRED to submit your work in .pdf and .Rnw (using \verb`knitr` and \verb`LaTeX`). Reproducible research is part of our training. Tell me if you need help in this regard.

I could code the website so that your assignment wouldn't be accepted otherwise -- but that's too harsh, so for now the penalty comes through grading.
\end{itemize}
