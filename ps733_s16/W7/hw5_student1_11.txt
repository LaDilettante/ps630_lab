- You say "likelihood" when you mean "odd", for example by "log likelihood" you actually mean "log odds"
- For 2e, you should remove "independent" from the data set instead of recoding

- For 2e, you should remove "independent" from the data set instead of recoding

3. Chang
- For 2d, I think you need to recode tpid so that it ranges from 1-3. Indeed, it's hard to believe that PRE is actually negative
- In addition to interpretation on the log-odds scale, also interpret on the odds scale

4. Chen, Bidan
- Have you tried using the regular zelig() instead of zologit$new()?
- 2e missing?

- In addition to log-odd scale interpretation, add odd scale interpretation. Otherwise very good

- Your "modelfit" wasn't actually estimated. See error message: you need to recode y accordingly
