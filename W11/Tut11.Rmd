# 1. Diagnostic techniques



# 2. Functional form specifications



# 3. Imputation of missing data

We often deal with missing data for some observations. Imputation allows us to make statistical inferences about the missing data values. Our guesses are based on the data that we have. For the imputation of missing data, we will use a package by Gary King called "Amelia".

install.packages("Amelia")

```{r}

```



# 4. The most useful R packages for applied work

The following are some of the most useful packages for applied work. I recommend to get the related text books and download the documentations of these packages. These packages have many useful commands that can help you to deal with data management and data analysis.

1. car --- associated with Fox & Weisberg's book "Companion to Applied Regression"
2. arm --- associated with Gelman & Hill's book on "Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models"
3. Zelig --- by political science professor Gary King, see: http://zeligproject.org/
4. ggplot2 --- introduced extensively in Chang's "R Graphics Cookbook"
5. stargazer
