\subparagraph{a)} (2 points) Assume that you have the following linear model

\^{Y} $= 10 + 5*X_1 + (-2)*X_2 + (-1)*X_1*X_2 + \epsilon$

Calculate the first derivative of \^{Y} with respect to X1 and X2. Then plot the effect that $X_1$ has on $Y$ at different levels of $X_2$. Assume that $X2 \in [-10,10]$. You may use R to plot the effect of $X_1$ on $Y$.

\subparagraph{b)} (2 points) Assume that you have two sets of points from the data based on which the model was estimated. These were some true observed values of the variables:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item $X_1=6, X_2=3, and Y = 16$
	\item $X_1=7, X_2=3, and Y = 17$
\end{enumerate}

Please plug $X_1$ and $X_2$ into the model and write down the predicted value of Y that you obtain. Then compare the predicted value to the true value. Is any of the two sets of points inconsistent with the linear model estimated above? Explain your answer carefully.
